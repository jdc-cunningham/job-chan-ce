- [ ] fast way to add ignore companies from webpage (inject x button next to company name)
  - guess this means block jobs will use localStorage tied to website
    none of this info is secret so doesn't really matter but it's nice to have secure context it's possible via background.js and an API/db but more work

Alright finally putting some time down on this

I did not sleep that great, currently distracted by my AC being broken/waiting for person to come in and fix it and also my missed payments/overdraft bank account

Turns out quitting a six fig remote job without a plan is a mistake (while also being in a lot of debt with high monthly payments)

10:43 AM

Struggling... I ran out of creamer so I'm drinking half as strong coffee straight up, it's nasty

11:38 AM

Still screwing around, social media scrolling

Let's go now

One of the main mechanisms for this extension is the scrolling job sidebar, it does some lazy loading

So the filter has to run after you stop scrolling this section

12:20 PM

making some progress, still trying to put it together, next is to inject buttons to remove stuff easily

12:55 PM

I'm struggling today, really hope maintenance fixes my AC while I'm home

1:03 PM

Alright trying again now

1:10 PM

Just distracted

1:48 PM

Progress is slow, this is not hard to do I'm just mentally all over the place right now

2:57 PM

It's so funny how there are so many things being blocked by ublock origin on LinkedIn the devtools freezes

Then my code tries to run on top of that like ugh

Man... I slept way too long today

Like 12 hrs

7:16 PM

Ugh... I'm tired af, Thursdays are the worst days for me. I have to reset my sleep pattern. I'm lucky to sleep 4 hrs on this day usually it's less.

Thankfully my job is labor so I can do it even without much sleep long as I have 5 hr/caffeine.

Bare minimum I'm going to add a code injector part via unpacked chrome extension

It will listen to the scroll down/end event on LinkedIn and then apply the "remove" jobs.

Needs dynamic company list too.

Mostly I need to just start applying again even if the odds are against me these days (I'm nobody).

7:33 PM

Alright code injected, still using manifest 2, briefly tried 3 but immediately there is something wrong lol

<img src="./devlog-images/alive.JPG"/>

Ahh man... I have to remember the communication process between background.js and other context if necessary

7:43 PM

Ugh... eyes hurt, will try again later today while I'm applying.

Should be 2 hours from now or so
